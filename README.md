# CSE6140-Project: Minimum Vertex Cover
*Rao Fu, Huizi Shao, Shangru Yi, Zhe Zhou*
 
Team project repo for **CSE6140 (FALL 2020)** in ***Georgia Institution of Technology***
 
The Minimum Vertex Cover (**MVC**) problem is a typical NP-complete problem that plays a significant role 
in many practical applications such as operation research, network security, computational biology and parallel machine scheduling. 
In this project, four algorithms, i.e. Branch-and-Bound (BnB), Max Degree Greedy Approximation, 
Two Weighting Local Search (Cai, Shaowei, etc. AAAI'15), Simulated Annealing Local Search are implemented to obtain the minimum vertex cover (MVC). 
A dummy solution using **NetworkX** is also included in this project for reference. Please refer to ``/doc/ProjectDescription.pdf`` and ``/doc/report.pdf`` for project details.

## Install Python Dependencies for Local Running
This project use Python 3+ (3.7.4 for implementation). We recommend to use python virtual environment to avoid possible dependency conflicts.

Following shell snippet can be used to create a local virtual environment.
```shell script
For windows:
  cmd cd to current directory (../CSE6140-Project/)
  
  python3 -m venv env
  env\Scripts\activate.bat  # activate virtual environment
  pip install -r dependencies.txt

For linux / MacOS:
  terminal cd to current directory (../CSE6140-Project/)
  
  python3 -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate  # activate virtual environment
  pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

After the virtual environment is created and activated, use following command to run scripts.
```shell script
python main.py -inst <filePath> -alg [BnB|Approx|LS1|LS2] -time <cutoff in seconds> -seed <random seed>
#for bnb, can try:  python <bnb.py> -inst <filePath> -alg BnB -time 600 -seed 100 . Will also works.
# see more usage with -h (batch run, experiment repeat, solution completeness check, etc. 
# filePath example (relative path): ./data/Data/dummy1.graph
```

If you install new package to the environment, **make sure you update `dependencies.txt` with correct package name and version, and commit**. 
Just add the main package with version to `dependencies.txt` should be fine. Refer to `dependencies.txt` for example dependencies. 

Following shell snippet can be used to retrieve installed package lists.
```shell script
pip freeze  # get current installed packages and version info
```
